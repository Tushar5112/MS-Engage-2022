# MS-Engage-2022

This repository contains my work which I had done in my **Microsoft Engage 2022 program.**

All the mentee were choice of choosing any one of the project, which they feel appealing to them, in whichever tech stack they wish.

I have choosen the third one, i.e. ***Algorithms*** as it appeared to me as an opportunity to learn more and grow.

### Problem Statement 
***Demonstrate through your app the different kinds of algorithms that a web-streaming app (like Netflix) or an audio-streaming app (like Spotify) may use for their Recommendation Engine.***

##### Firstly, What is a recommendation engine?
A recommendation engine is a software tool that tries either to upsell or crosssell a particular product or service.


##### Why it is used?
In this online era, a recommendation engine is must to have for all online partners, as it is useful in tracking user behaviour and earn profits accordingly.

Focus on any algorithm that you choose to highlight, for example:

###### Q.1 Demonstrate what kind of role would a sorting algorithm play in a Recommendation Engine? 
Sorting algorithm is a recommendation engine is just like that of salt in one's favourite meal. Unlike, saltless food feels tasteless, the recommendation engine without a sorting algorithm is useless. As, it will fail in its primary function.


###### Q.2 What is the most efficient sorting algorithm to use in this scenario, and why?
In my scenario, quick sort is the most effficient sorting algorithm as it performs good on large data sets (in my case data set is of approx 5000 entries).

Upon research, i know that many online platforms such as **Amazon Prime** uses their own developed **A9 Algorithm**,
**Google** uses its own **Page Rank Algorithm**,
**Netfix** uses both **Machine Learning and Dividing Data in two types :-** ***Implicit & Explicit***

# My Experience
At last, I just want to say that, this one month is the best, in terms of learning new technology, exposure, espically the workshops and the session organised by them were super cool. 

**Thank You! Microsoft**
